# Introduction

This guidebook will walk you through all of the steps necessary to complete your term assignment. The steps involve:

Phase 1:

1. Downloading and installing R Statistical Software

2. Downloading and installing R Studio for your specific platform (Windows or Mac)

3. Setting up R and getting comfy with the basics

Phase 2:

1. Design your study

2. Generate your data

3. Visualize your data

4. Test your results

5. Write up your results

6. Knit your R document into a lovely APA formatted pdf for handing in (don't worry, you'll learn how to do this part!)

## Why R? 

A key goal for any psychology researcher is not only to design and execute experiments, but to *communicate* your results to other people. As Psychologists the main way that we do this is through journal publication. is reproducible. 


Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## What you will learn

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
