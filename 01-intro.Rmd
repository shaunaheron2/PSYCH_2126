# Installing R and R Studio

All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file.

## Installing R

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

## Installing R Studio

There are some great detailed walkthrough videos by Danielle Narvarro on YouTube re: how to install R on both Windows and Mac.

### Windows

1.  [R and R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

You will first click "Install R". From the next page, you will choose one of the top linksâ€“either R for Windows or R for macOS, depending on your laptop.

Use the default install settings if at all possible.

Once R is installed, click the link above again and this time go to step 2: Install R Studio

### Mac

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
