The material we will cover in this short assignment will only give you a taste of what R is capable of. For advanced operations, you will need to learn more.

The best way to become more proficient with R, like any tool, is to actively use it. I learned R from the internet out of frustration with the limitations of SPSS. Though there was lots of trial and error and mistakes at first, over time I got better and better, and had to look up code less and less.

At first it may feel daunting, but you will quickly see that there are amazing resources online. FOr example, maybe you want make your wide dataset long for some multilevel analysesâ€“how do you do this in R? Well, a simple "how to make wide dataset long in R" will conjur up thousands of useful links where you can simply copy and paste their code and then just adjust it to use with your specific data. "How do I run an ANOVA in R?" or "ANOVA tutorial in R" will find you:

The great thing about these kinds of tutorials is that they include the code and often the rationalization as to why they are conducting the analyses like they are with recommendations of what steps should come first as well as how you would test any assumptions. You will learn SOOO much not just about R, but about data this way.
