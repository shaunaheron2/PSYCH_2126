# Lab 1: Putting it all Together

## If my template isn't working - Option 2

Hi class, some of you may find that the template I create isn't working. Unfortunately, R made some changes that impacted the template depending on which version of R Studio you have installed. As a result, there could be some issues. That being said, there is a new APA format now which is actually MUCH easier to use. Follow the instructions below step by step to run it.

1.  Open R Studio

2.  In the Console to the right, click on `Terminal` (should be top right)

3.  In the terminal copy and paste the following: `quarto use template wjschne/apaquarto` . You may have to hold CTRL-SHIFT-V to paste it or right click and paste because the usual CTR-V doesn't work in terminal. Once you paste it in click enter, then Y for yes and type APA to create an APA folder for your paper.

4.  Once installed, click on the file tab (to the right), and you'll see several files. Next download the file linked here:

    ```         
    xfun::embed_file('images/PretendThesis.qmd')
    ```

and add the file to the same APA folder.

# Learning More

-   [Papaja Manual](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/reporting.html)

The material we will cover in this short assignment will only give you a taste of what R is capable of. For advanced operations, you will need to learn more.

The best way to become more proficient with R, like any tool, is to actively use it. I learned R from the internet out of frustration with the limitations of SPSS. Though there was lots of trial and error and mistakes at first, over time I got better and better, and had to look up code less and less.

At first it may feel daunting, but you will quickly see that there are amazing resources online. FOr example, maybe you want make your wide dataset long for some multilevel analysesâ€“how do you do this in R? Well, a simple "how to make wide dataset long in R" will conjur up thousands of useful links where you can simply copy and paste their code and then just adjust it to use with your specific data. "How do I run an ANOVA in R?" or "ANOVA tutorial in R" will find you:

The great thing about these kinds of tutorials is that they include the code and often the rationalization as to why they are conducting the analyses like they are with recommendations of what steps should come first as well as how you would test any assumptions. You will learn SOOO much not just about R, but about data this way.
