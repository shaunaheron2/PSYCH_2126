Heron for Dr. Emond’s Psych Class 2024-02-03 Chapter 1 Introduction This guidebook will walk you through all of the steps necessary to complete your term assignment. Get ready, because you are embarking on a journey… from the safe GUI point-and-click world of SPSS to the code-based Thunderdome of R. Where we’re going… 1.1 Goals The goal of the assignment is twofold: First, to give you the opportunity to flex what you are learning in class, and two, to introduce you R Statistical Software; a game-changer in any future research endeavors. This guide is meant as a companion to your assignment. It is not meant to be an in depth course on R, as that would be several entire courses on its own, but by the end you will have had a small taste of R and its capabilities. And who knows, it might ignite a spark of curiosity that jump starts a desire to learn more. By the end of this assignment, you will have read a bunch of interesting research papers, designed a mini study based on a theory of your choice and completed some analyses and a full write up in R that you will hand in. Your paper will include everything a person would need to reproduce your experiment from start to finish. Don’t worry about HOW we’ll do this yet, just know that you will. 1.2 What can R do? Disclaimer: I do NOT work for R. I just love it. Advanced statistical analyses without paying for packages (it’s open source!) The best data visualization capabilities of ANY statistical software Reproducible research is made easy, an integral partner of Open Science research Thousands of free online resources to learn anything you don’t know Did I say its open source.. ? Make gorgeous publication-ready papers and books with inline analyses Make gorgeous slideshows with analyses and text all in one document Make gorgeous websites (This website you’re reading is made 100% in R) Juice up your resume (researchers with R skills are a HUGE asset and hard to come by) Help you understand data better because the analysis isn’t happening behind a graphic user interface Ramp up your street cred 1000%.

Collaborating on groundbreaking research, they challenged traditional economic theories of “rational behaviour” by revealing the systematic biases and cognitive errors characteristic of human decision-making. The work of these two will be the focus of your research. Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his and Amos’ groundbreaking work in human decision-making. 2.2 Stage 1: Literature Review The evolution of a hypothesis Your first job is to: Find one of K&amp;T’s original research papers with Google Scholar or the Laurentian Omni library with a theory/hypothesis that you can follow from the original paper through subsequent papers until today. Your aim is to find at least 9 studies that build on and test that theory. Do not choose an obscure theory that only 2 people have heard about. You won’t garner extra marks for this. For the purposes of this exercise, the theory or hypothesis you choose should be well tested. So, your first study will be a Kahneman and Tversky study, next, a study that sits on the shoulders of that study, then another that progressed from that study, and so on until you find a study conducted between 2020 and today. A minimum of 10 articles should be cited. As Dr. Emond says, “Kind of like six degrees of separation but with citations”. These will make up your intro and discussion references in the final write-up. The point of this exercise is to get familiar with how a theory and the questions that arise from it, change and evolve over time–not just with new evidence but with fresh perspectives of the different researchers that test them. 2.3 Stage 2: Study Design Once you have chosen one of T&amp;K’s theories, you will design an experiment to test it. Next steps: Informed by your research in Stage 1 and the experiment you would like to conduct, write a short intro/literature review, explaining the question you are exploring and referencing the articles you identified in you Stage 1. This write-up will eventually be placed in the intro section of the R document you create. Some points your intro should include: Where did K&amp;T’s original hypothesis/theory come from (what previous theories informed it?) How did K&amp;T test the hypothesis/theory originally and how has the methodology been refined/evolved over time? What were the findings? Were they expected or unexpected? How did the results inform new questions? How will you test the theory in a hypothetical experiment? Remember, you’re not writing a thesis, so don’t go too crazy here (see word count recommendations in the sidebar for expected counts). Be sure to state your purpose, hypothesis and any other questions you would like to answer clearly and with justification. Make sure to operationally define your independent variable(s) and dependent variable(s). Keep in mind you should choose a research design that demonstrates your understanding of the concepts learned in class. A factorial design will blow our socks off. Describe your design, procedure and planned statistical analysis (e.g. ANOVA, t-tests, MANOVA, etc.) clearly in the Methods section. Do not forget to explain how you will control for any confounding variables. For all of the parts above, complete descriptions must be given. In full detail. Also, you must justify all of your choices. Why you decided to design it the way you did and define your variables the way you did. There are a couple of ways you can tackle this step: Do your write up in Word first, then copy and paste it into R when you’re ready. Do what I do, write directly in R. HOWEVER, because R can be intimidating and confusing at first and I don’t want you losing hours of work with a mistake, it might be smart to have a copy of your write up in Word or Google Docs, just in case! Once you get the knack of R you’ll never have to use Word as back up again. But for now, it might give you peace of mind and its very easy to copy and paste your write up directly into R. It’s what I did in the beginning and it worked like a charm. 2.4 Stage 3: R Analysis &amp; Writeup Now that you have your design nailed down, you will email the design (including the expected range/levels of your outcome variable) to Shauna (the TA). You can send this in a word document or copy and paste the design into an email. Within a couple of days you will receive some “fake” experimental data that corresponds to your design and chosen outcome. You will use this data for your “analysis” in R. Be sure to submit your design and outcome requirements to Shauna at least ONE MONTH before the final due date so you have time to troubleshoot any problems you might have with R as well as analyze &amp; write up your results and discussion. Steps to complete while waiting for your data: Install R and R Studio and customize your workspace (see R Tutorials). You do not have to wait until this step to install R. In fact I would install it near the beginning just so you have it ready to go when its time for this step. Once you have your dataset, you will start your data analyses. You’ll find a video tutorial to follow (see Analysis Tutorial that will be uploaded by February 10th) where l will walk you through how to visualize your data, conduct your analysis (ANOVA, correlations or anything else your heart desires), and finally save it all as a publication ready pdf. You will plot at least one data visualization that conveys your main results. Write a BRIEF summary of your “findings” (mini-results) in your Results section. Copy and paste your entire write-up into your R document. Remember, there needs to be an Introduction, Methods, Results and a short Discussion/Conclusion. Finally, write a very brief conclusion that wraps it all up, including at least two things you learned (or didn’t learn) during this assignment! Knit your pdf from R and hand it in via Dropbox on D2l (this step will be included in the video tutorial). If you have trouble with any part of this assignment, email me at sheron@laurentian.ca to set up a zoom or in person meeting. I’m here to help! 2.5 Assignment Checklist Make sure your final document includes: A brief introduction to the topic, explaining the theory you are exploring and referencing the article(s) it is grounded in (see Stage 1) with a clearly stated purpose and hypothesis. A Methods section that describes your sample population, design and procedure and includes clear operational definitions for your independent, control and dependent variable(s). Do not forget to explain how you will control for any confounding variables A BRIEF summary of your “findings”* in the Results section, including: a visualization of your outcome variable distribution (e.g. histogram). The descriptive statistics of your sample population (e.g. number of participants in each group, average scores in each group etc). At least one visualization that conveys your main results (e.g. your treatment effect). A brief discussion connecting your results to past research and the direction that future research could take. A one paragraph conclusion that wraps it all up. including at least two sentences that share what you learned or didn’t learn during this assignment. A cover page and reference page at the end (APA formatted). Hand in everything to D2l as a knitted pdf (see tutorial). Click this link to see the R APA manuscript template you will be filling out. What you are looking at is the pdf rendered output of the R document. 2.6 Word Count &amp; Formatting Your final document should be APA formatted with citations and a reference page. I don’t mind if you keep your visualizations inline (rather than at the back), as it makes for an easier comparison of visualizations with the results. The template you will be using to create your R document is already APA formatted, so this step should be easy for you. Your intro and discussion should contain no more than 2000 words combined–as per the max word count of most modern publications. Similarly, your methods and results should contain no more than 2000 words combined (APS, 2023)–though 1000-1500 should be more than enough for our purposes. You won’t need as much space for results as your analysis will be simpler than the average real paper. I would say your Intro, Methods, Results and Discussion (not counting the cover page and references) should be approximately 8-12 double-spaced pages. You will not be penalized for going over that; at the same time, overwriting won’t win you extra marks, either. Keep it clear and concise! "],["Intro.html", "Chapter 3 R Tutorials 3.1 Getting Started 3.2 R Markdown 3.3 Analysis Tutorial", " Chapter 3 R Tutorials 3.1 Getting Started First things first: why R? The reason we want to learn R, is that it allows us to great reproducible resarch To get started, we will follow along with Andy Field’s brilliant tutorials which will walk us through: Installing R and RStudio Customizing your workspace Workflow in R Studio Loading packages and creating your first project Creating an R Markdown document R Markdown basics If you run into problems, don’t hesitate to reach out to me sheron@laurentian.ca for help. I can always meet you in person or via zoom to get you sorted. There is also loads of online help available that’s usually only a Google away. 3.1.1 Installing R &amp; R Studio To Install R and R Studio we will follow along with Andy’s “Installing R and R Studio” tutorial. The R interface can be a bit intimidating at first, stick with it though as it does become easier over time, and you’ll feel like a total wizard in the future when you start to know your way around. 3.1.2 Customizing your workspace Next we will follow a Quick Tour of R Studio to get to know our way around and customize the workspace. I have my workspace set up the same way and find it the best way. To open R Studio for the first time, click on the Windows icon and search for it or on a Mac search for R Studio in the application search bar (top right). 3.1.3 Create your project Next, we will follow along with the Working in RStudio tutorial. Don’t get too bogged down in his explanation of workflow and folder structure; however, you will create an R Studio project file for your assignment. Follow along and create your own project–this will be the folder for your assignment. At 8:24 in the video, you will follow along to create your project. Your project folder will be on your computer (rather than on OneDrive as he does in the video). The best place for this is off your documents folder. Your new project window will look something like the image below. The Directory name is whatever you’d like to call your project. Ignore the tick boxes but do go ahead and click “Open in new session”. From inside your new project, create a data folder from the file pane (follow along with Andy). No need to create an r.docs folder like he does. Create an R Markdown file (12:56 in the video) Follow along with the rest of the tutorial to get to know R Markdown. Don’t worry if everything is as clear as mud, we’ll learn more about RMarkdown soon. Move to the next step: installing packages. 3.1.4 Install Packages Next, we will follow along with the Install Packages tutorial. Install the packages he recommends. Install the following packages as well by copy and pasting the code below to your console and hitting return. install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;,&quot;papaja&quot;, &quot;psych&quot;, &quot;DataExplorer&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;sjPlot&quot;, &quot;dlookr&quot;, &quot;apaTables&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;) We will also install the tutorial package that I created for you, which will include an assignment template. It will make things easier to create an APA-formatted document in R Markdown. Copy and paste the following code into your console and hit enter: remotes::install_github(&quot;shaunaheron2/psych2126template&quot;) Once packages are installed, click “Session” then Restart R” (in the top menu of R Studio) to refresh your workspace. Load the packages we just installed by adding them to the library chunk of your R Markdown document. Hint: copy and paste the code below. You can also load them by adding the code to your console window. library(tidyverse) # powerful data wrangling tool ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ── ## ✔ dplyr 1.1.3 ✔ readr 2.1.4 ## ✔ forcats 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.5.0 ## ✔ ggplot2 3.4.4 ✔ tibble 3.2.1 ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.3 ✔ tidyr 1.3.0 ## ✔ purrr 1.0.2 ## ── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors library(here) ## here() starts at D:/documents/Research_Methods_Guidebook library(dlookr) # powerful data exploration tool ## ## Attaching package: &#39;dlookr&#39; ## ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:tidyr&#39;: ## ## extract ## ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## transform library(papaja) ## Loading required package: tinylabels library(base) library(psych) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;psych&#39; ## ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:dlookr&#39;: ## ## describe ## ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:ggplot2&#39;: ## ## %+%, alpha library(DataExplorer) # used to explore data library(ggplot2) # powerful plotting app library(sjPlot) # this is for plotting ## Install package &quot;strengejacke&quot; from GitHub (`devtools::install_github(&quot;strengejacke/strengejacke&quot;)`) to load all sj-packages at once! library(psych2126template) # this is our template library(apaTables) 3.2 R Markdown Be sure that you’ve already installed Papaja and have it loaded in your environment before working along with the tutorial. In this step Andy will walk you through the basics of R Markdown. Be sure you completed the previous steps under Getting Started. Follow along with Andy’s tutorial to get to know the basics. Now you will create an APA formatted document that contains your text write up, your data analysis and your references. You will use this document to create your reproducible scientific paper. Follow along with this video for a step-by-step walkthrough. Note: you won’t select the Papaja template as he does, instead select the AssignmentTemplate you installed and loaded above. For whatever reason, if you don’t see the AssignmentTemplate, just select the APA-style manuscript instead. Nick’s workspace looks a bit different because he is using a dark theme for his workspace. To change your theme, remember you go to Tools –&gt; Global Options –&gt; Appearance pane. From your project workspace, you’ll click File –&gt; New R Markdown and select “From Template” then “AssignmentTemplate”. Make sure you installed the packages above or you won’t see the template here. Where it says name, give your document a name–like “My Assignment” or whatever else you’d like to call it then click OK. Try clicking the Knit button to see how the template renders the R Markdown. Once the document has rendered, you’ll find a .pdf file in your project folder. If it didn’t open automatically, click on it in the file pane. Once it is open, you can make changes to the R Markdown and when you click knit you’ll see them in the pdf. Sometimes you have to click refresh in your browser to load the changes. You’ll notice I added three figures using the iris dataset that comes loaded in R: A histogram A boxplot Violin plots Follow along with Nick to learn about Papaja and to customize the template. Nick has a different file structure. He is not working from a project, but you will be if you followed Andy’s instructions above. This means your workspace already knows where the working directory is–its your project folder (which will be off your documents folder if you put it here like I suggested). Just ignore where he puts his files, but everything else is good to follow :) # install.packages(&quot;papaja&quot;) # remove the hashtag at the beginning of this line and run the code to install papaja if you haven&#39;t already (see above) library(papaja) Nick refers to his console at the bottom of the screen, if you followed Andy’s workspace setup it will be on the right side of your screen. 3.3 Analysis Tutorial If you don’t already have your data from Shauna, practice with pre-loaded datasets (iris, cars). Here are some tutorials that complement this section. Simply copy and paste the code below into a codechunk in your project and then run them. Feel free to play around with the code–its the best way to learn. 3.3.1 Descriptive Table The first step in analysing any new dataset is to describe and visualize it. Luckily there are some handy packages to help us do this. Let’s use the iris dataset. Load the iris dataframe and store it in an object we’ll call “df” df &lt;- data.frame(iris) The describe command from the dlookr packages allows you to see the mean, standard deviation and skewness of your data right away. descriptives &lt;- describe(df) You can see there are 5 variables, 4 sepal measurements and a species variable. If you’d like to look at your dataframe in a table format, use the view command. This will open a sortable table of your dataframe in another tab. To get back to your R Markdown document click on the tab containing it at the top of your workspace. view(df) You can also use the gt command to create a pretty, customizable table in your document. library(gt) descriptives %&gt;% gt() #yflpcmwaxc table { font-family: system-ui, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji';

This is a great way to check your outcome variable for normality. Remember, most statistical tests have a set of assumptions that if violated, make the results of said tests unreliable. plot_histogram(df) The histograms tell us a few things: the Petal length histogram tells us that petal length is NOT a normal distribution. Its bimodal, meaning there are two distributions in one. Some petals are really short and some are medium to long. Lucky for us our outcome variable (sepal length) seems relatively normal. We could also look at correlations to see if there are underlying relationships we need to consider in our data: 3.3.3 Correlations plot_correlation(na.omit(df), maxcat = 5L) 3.3.4 T-Tests # To run a t-test, our grouping variable can only have two levels, while Species has 4, so we;re just going to look at the difference between two levels df2 &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(Species==&quot;setosa&quot;|Species==&quot;versicolor&quot;) %&gt;% droplevels() t.test(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = df2) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: Sepal.Length by Species ## t = -10.521, df = 86.538, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group setosa and group versicolor is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.1057074 -0.7542926 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group setosa mean in group versicolor ## 5.006 5.936 apa_print( t.test(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = df2) ) ## $estimate ## [1] &quot;$\\\\Delta M = -0.93$, 95\\\\% CI $[-1.11, -0.75]$&quot; ## ## $statistic ## [1] &quot;$t(86.54) = -10.52$, $p &lt; .001$&quot; ## ## $full_result ## [1] &quot;$\\\\Delta M = -0.93$, 95\\\\% CI $[-1.11, -0.75]$, $t(86.54) = -10.52$, $p &lt; .001$&quot; ## ## $table ## A data.frame with 5 labelled columns: ## ## estimate conf.int statistic df p.value ## 1 -0.93 [-1.11, -0.75] -10.52 86.54 &lt; .001 ## ## estimate : $\\\\Delta M$ ## conf.int : 95\\\\% CI ## statistic: $t$ ## df : $\\\\mathit{df}$ ## p.value : $p$ ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;apa_results&quot; &quot;list&quot; 3.3.5 Factorial ANOVA 3.3.6 Visualize Results "],["putting-it-all-together.html", "Chapter 4 Putting it all together 4.1 Learning More", " Chapter 4 Putting it all together This will show you how to complete your final document containing your analysis and writeup then how to render it as a pdf. 4.1 Learning More Papaja Manual The material we will cover in this short assignment will only give you a taste of what R is capable of. For advanced operations, you will need to learn more. The best way to become more proficient with R, like any tool, is to actively use it. I learned R from the internet out of frustration with the limitations of SPSS. Though there was lots of trial and error and mistakes at first, over time I got better and better, and had to look up code less and less. At first it may feel daunting, but you will quickly see that there are amazing resources online. FOr example, maybe you want make your wide dataset long for some multilevel analyses–how do you do this in R? Well, a simple “how to make wide dataset long in R” will conjur up thousands of useful links where you can simply copy and paste their code and then just adjust it to use with your specific data. “How do I run an ANOVA in R?” or “ANOVA tutorial in R” will find you: https://statsandr.com/blog/anova-in-r/ The great thing about these kinds of tutorials is that they include the code and often the rationalization as to why they are conducting the analyses like they are with recommendations of what steps should come first as well as how you would test any assumptions. You will learn SOOO much not just about R, but about data this way.
