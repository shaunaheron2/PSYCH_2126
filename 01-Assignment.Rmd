# The Assignment {#cross}

## Meet Kahneman & Tversky

Amos Tversky (left: 1937-1996) and Daniel Kahneman (right: 1934-) transformed the field of behavioural economics in the 70s and 80s. Collaborating on groundbreaking research, they challenged traditional economic theories of "rational behaviour" by revealing the systematic biases and cognitive errors characteristic of human decision-making. The work of these two will be the focus of your research.

::: fyi
Daniel Kahneman was awarded the [Nobel Peace](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2002/kahneman/facts/) Prize in 2002 for his and Amos' groundbreaking work in human decision-making.

## Assignment Stage 1 {#Part1}

Your first job is to:

1. Find **one** of K&T's original research papers with Google Scholar or the [Laurentian Omni library](https://omni.laurentian.ca/discovery/search?vid=01OCUL_LU:OMNI&lang=en "Laurentian Library"). 

2. Find at least 9 more studies that build/test the theories before. So, your first study will be a Kahneman and Tversky study, next, a study that sits on the shoulders of that study, then another that progressed from that study, and so on until you find a study conducted between 2020 and today. 

3. READ THEM.

4. A *minimum* of 10 articles should be cited. As Dr. Emond says, "Kind of like six degrees of separation but with citations".

::: puzzle
As you're reading, make note of theories that interest you. You will eventually *pick one* to design an experiment around.

## Assignment Stage 2 {#Part2}

Next you will choose *one* of T&K's *well-tested* theories and design your own **experiment** to test it.

**Steps to complete next:**

1.  Write a brief introduction to the topic, explaining the theory you are exploring and referencing the article(s) it is based on. You will place this in the intro section of the document you create.
2.  Be sure to state your hypothesis and any other questions you would like to answer *clearly*.
3.  Make sure to *operationally define* your independent variable(s) and dependent variable(s). Keep in mind you should choose a design that demonstrates your understanding of the concepts learned in class. A factorial design will blow our socks off.
4.  Describe your design and procedure clearly in the Methods section.
5.  Do not forget to explain how you will control for any confounding variables.

:::fyi
For all of the parts above, **complete** descriptions must be given. In **full detail**. Also, you must **justify** all of your choices. Why you decided to design it the way you did and define your variables the way you did.

Once these steps are close to completion you can move to the next step:

## Assignment Stage 3

There are a couple of ways you can tackle this next step, integrating your write-up with your R analyses:

1.  **Do your write up in Word first**, then copy and paste it into R when you're ready.

2.  **Do what I do, write directly in R**.

HOWEVER, because R can be intimidating and confusing at first and I don't want you losing hours of work with a mistake, it might be smart to have a copy of your write up in Word or Google Docs, just in case! Once you get the knack of R you'll never have to use Word as back up again. But for now, it might give you peace of mind and its very easy to copy and paste your write up directly into R. It's what I did in the beginning and it worked like a charm.

```

**Steps you will complete in R:**

1. Install R and R Studio and customize your workspace (see R Tutorials). 

2.  Create a set of data that your design (and specific dependent variable) would produce. What would your data look like? 

:::fyi
I will help with this part! No need to worry about it yet, first do your research, write up your intro and methods and THEN we'll create the data.

2.  Once you have your dataset, you will start your data analyses. You'll find a video tutorial to follow (see Analysis Tutorial that will be uploaded by February 10th) where l will walk you through how to visualize your data, conduct your analysis (ANOVA, correlations or anything else your heart desires), and finally save it all as a pdf. 

3.  Create at least one data visualization that conveys your main results.

9.  Write a BRIEF summary of your "findings" (mini-results) in your Results section.

10. Copy and paste your entire write-up into your R document. Remember, there needs to be an Introduction, Methods, Results and a short Discussion/Conclusion.

10. Finally, write a very brief conclusion that wraps it all up, including at least two things you learned (or didn't learn) during this assignment!

11. Knit your pdf from R and hand it in via Dropbox on D2l (this step will be included in the video tutorial).

## Assignment Checklist

Your final submission will be a knitted R Markdown pdf document that includes:

1. **A brief introduction** to the topic, explaining the theory you are exploring and referencing the article(s) it is based on. This should be in the introduction section.
2.  A **clearly** stated **hypothesis**.
3.  Make sure to **operationally define your independent variable(s) and dependent variable(s)**. Keep in mind you should choose a design that demonstrates your understanding of the concepts learned in class. A factorial design will blow our socks off.
4.  A **Methods** section that describes your **design and procedure** clearly.
5.  Do not forget to explain how you will control for any **confounding variables**.
6.  A visualization of your outcome variable's distribution (e.g. histogram) 
7.  At least one visualization that conveys your main results (e.g. your treatment effect).
9.  A BRIEF summary of your "findings" in the Results section.
10. A very brief conclusion wrapping it all up and including at least two sentences that include two things you learned or didn't learn during this assignment!
11. A reference page at the end (APA formated)
11. Hand in everything as a knitted pdf (see tutorial).
